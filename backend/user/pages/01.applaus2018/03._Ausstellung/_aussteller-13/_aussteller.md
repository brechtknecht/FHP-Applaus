The FHP website provides access to different kinds of information. Whether users want to learn more about the organisation, look for some info-services, need the course catalogue, or access to a specific department, they depend on the site navigation. Ideally, its interface design should help them to find what they are looking for. However, the analysis of FHP website has shown, that the navigation works »well enough«, allowing students to access what they need to – but after some struggle. For that reason, this project outlines some of these navigation problems, makes suggestions to improve user experience and information architecture. The thesis ends with a visualisation about an alternative navigation system in comparison with the current menu flow.
