»Les Rouflaquettes« is a film about the re-staging of trauma, about the journey of personal and historical memories in post-dictatorial societies and the fragile balance between fiction and truth we attribute to the notion of ›reality‹. The story takes place in Albania. Its protagonist is a painter (Ilir) in his mid sixties, who recalls a traumatic event of his late teenage years. The second character is Jean-Luc, a projection of Ilir played by Ilir himself. This unusual duplicity triggers challenging strategies for the recuperation of memory and a reconciliation with the self.
