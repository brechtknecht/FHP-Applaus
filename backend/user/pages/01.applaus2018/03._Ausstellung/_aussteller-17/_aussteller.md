Nowadays, the significant role data plays in economic growth is widely recognized. Many countries and enterprises are striving to collect data and analyze data. In this data ecosystem, the general public seems to be just the provider of economic data and has little to do with economic data analysis. However, due to the emergence of open data and information visualization, they are about to have a share of the benefit of data. For example, coffee shop owners use visualization tools to analyze regional population distribution by age to predict new customer demand for coffee and cake; job seekers use visualization tools to discover industry distribution in the world and know where there are better opportunities for them. In this way, economic knowledge can be popularized and local economy will prosper. Great Britain’s Ordnance Survey, New York Business Atlas and the Atlas of Economic Complexity are all visualization tools of economic data, which were launched around 2000. They demonstrate economic data that would be understandable for general users to make business decisions. However, the design of many visualization tools still remains at the early phase – just to show the data clearly. The interaction for analysis in those tools is lacking. In addition, one of the most obvious difference between the analyst and the general public is that analyst have their own analytical tool, while the general public does not have that. Therefore, providing a means for the novices to analyze data is important in the visualization tools. The aim of this thesis is to design a framework that enhances the analytical interaction in the visualization of economic data so that users not just can read the data in the visualization, but they can also analyze the data, in order to form their insights from it.
